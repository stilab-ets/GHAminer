# GHAminer Configuration File
# ============================================================================
# This file controls which metrics are collected during data extraction.
# Set options to 'true' to enable or 'false' to disable specific metric groups.
# By default, all options are set to 'true' to collect the full set of metrics.
# 
# Disabling certain options can significantly reduce API calls and processing
# time, which is useful when you only need specific metrics.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WORKFLOW FILTERING
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Specify which workflows to analyze. By default, all workflows are processed.
#
# workflow_ids: List of specific workflow IDs to process.
#   - If empty ([]) or not specified: ALL workflows in the repository are processed.
#   - If populated: Only the specified workflow IDs will be analyzed.
#
# To find workflow IDs, you can:
#   1. Use the GitHub API: GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/workflows
#   2. Check the workflow run URL: https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runs/{run_id}
#      The workflow_id is visible in the API response or workflow details.
#
# Example with specific workflows:
#   workflow_ids:
#     - 12345678
#     - 87654321
#
# Example to process all workflows (default):
#   workflow_ids: []
#
workflow_ids: [9020027]


# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# JOB DETAILS
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# When enabled, fetches detailed information about each job in the workflow run.
# This includes job names, step details, start/end times, and durations.
#
# Columns added when enabled:
#   - gh_job_id          : List of job IDs in the workflow run
#   - total_jobs         : Total number of jobs in the workflow run
#   - job_details        : JSON structure with job/step names, times, and results

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# TEST PARSING RESULTS
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# When enabled, downloads and parses build logs to extract test results.
# Supports multiple test frameworks (pytest, JUnit, Jest, RSpec, etc.)

#   - tests_passed       : Number of tests that passed
#   - tests_failed       : Number of tests that failed
#   - tests_skipped      : Number of tests that were skipped
#   - tests_total        : Total number of tests executed
#
fetch_test_parsing_results: false


# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# COMMIT DETAILS
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# When enabled, analyzes the commits associated with each workflow run.
# Clones the repository locally to extract detailed commit information.
# This provides code churn metrics and contributor statistics.

#   - gh_lines_added             : Total lines of code added
#   - gh_lines_deleted           : Total lines of code deleted
#   - gh_src_churn               : Total source code churn (lines added + deleted)
#   - gh_tests_added             : Lines of test code added
#   - gh_tests_deleted           : Lines of test code deleted
#   - gh_test_churn              : Total test code churn (test lines added + deleted)
#   - gh_src_files               : Number of source code files changed
#   - gh_doc_files               : Number of documentation files changed
#   - gh_other_files             : Number of other files changed
#   - gh_commits_on_files_touched: Number of commits on touched files in last 3 months
#   - dockerfile_changed         : Number of Dockerfile changes in the commits
#   - docker_compose_changed     : Number of docker-compose file changes
#   - git_num_committers         : Total unique committers since project start
#   - git_commits                : Total commits in the repository up to this run
#   - gh_team_size_last_3_month  : Unique committers in the last 3 months
#
fetch_commit_details: true


# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# PULL REQUEST DETAILS
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# When enabled, fetches pull request information if the workflow run is
# associated with a PR. Useful for analyzing PR-triggered builds.
#
# Columns added when enabled:
#   - gh_pull_req_number      : Pull request number (0 if not a PR)
#   - gh_is_pr                : Boolean indicating if build is PR-related
#   - gh_num_pr_comments      : Number of comments on the PR
#   - git_merged_with         : SHA of the merge commit (if merged)
#   - gh_description_complexity: Word count of PR title + description
#
fetch_pull_request_details: true


# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# SOURCE LINES OF CODE (SLOC)
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# When enabled, calculates source lines of code and test density metrics.
# Uses the 'scc' tool to count lines at the specific commit.
# Note: This requires checking out each commit, which can be slow.
#
# Columns added when enabled:
#   - gh_sloc                 : Total source lines of code in the repository
#   - gh_test_lines_per_kloc  : Test density (test lines per 1,000 SLOC)
